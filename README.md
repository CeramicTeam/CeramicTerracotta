## Robots.txt Compliance  
Our crawler follows the `robots.txt` exclusion standard and identifies itself as **TerraCotta**. If youâ€™d prefer we avoid certain pages, simply add the following to your `robots.txt` file:  

```txt
User-agent: TerraCotta  
Disallow: /[directory-you-don't-want-us-to-visit]/  
Disallow: /[another-directory-to-exclude]/
